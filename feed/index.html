<p>You may have wondered why marketing is important for business. </p>



<p></p>



<p><em>Isn&#8217;t having a good product enough? </em></p>



<p></p>



<p>The truth is that &#8216;everything is marketing&#8217;. </p>



<p></p>



<p>Your packaging, your videos, your copy, your ads&#8230; <strong>It&#8217;s all marketing. </strong></p>



<p></p>



<p>Everything you do to sell your product or service is marketing. So it becomes really important for all businesses &#8211; and those who have terrible marketing, often make far less money. </p>



<p></p>



<p>In today&#8217;s attention economy, the people who can get the attention will make the most revenue. </p>



<p></p>



<p>So in that case, the practice of getting that attention is marketing. </p>



<p></p>

<p>A lot of people are worried, especially with the advent of AI, that marketing jobs &amp; agencies will become obsolete. </p>



<p>Here’s why that won’t happen…</p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading"><strong>SHORT ANSWER. NO.</strong></h2>



<p>A.I. is actually poorly defined by so many people. There currently isn’t such a thing as AI. &nbsp;</p>



<p>Platforms like ChatGPT and Google’s Gemini are actually large language models (LLM’s).</p>



<p>This means they scan and digest human creativity in order to spit back relevant answers and suggestions.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They can’t create right now, they can only iterate.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">GOOD NEWS FOR MARKETING&nbsp;</h2>



<p>So for the short-term, this is good news for marketing &amp; marketers professionally. Any AI tool can be used to trigger creativity or remind you of tactics that have long been forgotten.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps even steering you onto the most effective path.&nbsp;</p>



<p></p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">HERE’S ANOTHER REASON WHY IT COULD FAIL&nbsp;</h2>



<p>LLM’s like ChatGPT will be training themselves on answers that please you. So it’s more likely to deliver the same results to another marketing professional in future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If everyone uses the same prompts, everyone will get the same results.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This means those relying on AI will actually be competing in a denser marketplace. As you’ll be using the same tactics as millions of others.</p>



<p> </p>



<h2 class="wp-block-heading">THE SOLUTION&nbsp;</h2>



<p>You can use AI and LLM’s to help research your niche, or draft your offer &#8211; but the way you market your products needs to be unique.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unique marketing stands out… And as soon as it becomes a trend, you’ll lose people’s attention.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They’re mathematically identical, but this case study reveals buyer perception trumps numbers</p>



<p id="0976">Here’s a little math question. Imagine I have two different brands of whisky on sale. Identical liquid, amount, etc. Let’s pretend they taste the same, too.</p>



<p id="9806">One brand is $15, marked down from its original price of $30 per bottle.</p>



<p id="3f0d">The other brand is $30, but it’s ‘buy one bottle, get one free’.</p>



<p id="32aa">Which one is better value?</p>



<p id="83b0">Of course, it’s a trick question, and in terms of volume of liquid per dollar spent, the outcome is the same.</p>



<p id="4dcf">However, that’s not how a buyer perceives it, and when working as a marketing consultant, your choice could be the difference between thousands of dollars of potential revenue for your client.</p>



<p id="c2c2">Don’t make the mistake I did.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="e2d1">How Did I Come to Learn From This Mistake?</h1>



<p id="2988">One of my previous clients had the need to clear stock. Their product was seasonal, consumable, and had a sell-by date. It couldn’t be sat on shelves any longer.</p>



<p id="4b4f">To boost revenue and run-through stock, the simplest way was to run a flash sale. In my mind ‘buy one, get one free’ was the best option.</p>



<p id="e11b">Grocery stores do it all of the time as a way to lower inventory or simply boost average order value.</p>



<p id="b04c"><mark>I decided to split-test in&nbsp;</mark><mark><a href="https://www.mailchimp.com/" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Mailchimp</a></mark><mark>&nbsp;to see what the difference would be.</mark></p>



<p id="9fb1">The way the split test works is that the list is split into sections.</p>



<ul class="wp-block-list">
<li>25% of your list will get an email with subject line 1. offering ‘buy one, get one free’.</li>



<li>25% of your list will get an email with subject line 2. offering 50% off.</li>



<li>The best performing email is chosen.</li>



<li><mark>The remaining 50% of your email list receives the winning email.</mark></li>
</ul>



<p id="215d">Below are the number of opens for the email offering ‘buy one, get one free’.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1216/1*xi9OcMpJP1o9t8HkLEBDtA.png" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Open and click rate on the ‘buy one, get one’ offer.</figcaption></figure>



<p id="fac0">As you can see above, the first 25% of the email list this was sent to gave me almost 21,000 opens and over 2,000 clicks. All for offer 1.</p>



<p id="283f">The conversion rate was 3.7%</p>



<p id="fa53">The split test meant that the next subject line offered 50% off the product, instead of ‘buy one, get one free’. This was offer 2.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1248/1*fP5LynLPmILqzXtCCIJ3hA.png" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Open and click rate on the 50% OFF email offer.</figcaption></figure>



<p id="bd14">As you can see above, it received a 16.5%<strong>&nbsp;</strong>increase in email-open rate, but a staggering 27% increase in click-through rate.</p>



<p id="808d">More opens, more clicks, and far more sales.</p>



<p id="8d97">The conversion<mark>&nbsp;</mark>rate of this offer was 8.6% — huge.</p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="95e8">The Results: What You Should Offer</h1>



<figure class="wp-block-image"><img decoding="async" src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/1*jaMy-ZGeUEKjLYAgZ8AhHw.jpeg" alt=""/><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Photo by&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/@dsmacinnes?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Danielle MacInnes</a>&nbsp;on&nbsp;<a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/split?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Unsplash</a></figcaption></figure>



<p id="01de"><mark>Without going into too much detail for my client, the 50% off offer produced a sales uplift of 266%</mark><mark><strong>&nbsp;</strong></mark><mark>compared to its ‘buy one, get one free’ counterpart.</mark></p>



<p id="ddfb">Let that sink in: 266% more sales than the almost mathematically identical offer.</p>



<p id="ebee">Needless to say, we rolled with that for the rest of the email list sends and continued to position it as a 50% off sale.</p>



<p id="ffe9">In the years since, I’ve tested this offer again. In the exact same fashion with scientifically replicable results.</p>



<p id="705d">My own bias and preference towards ‘buy one, get one free’ was exposed to be false.&nbsp;<mark>Fifty percent off is far better.</mark></p>



<h1 class="wp-block-heading" id="4077">But Why Do People Prefer It? Framing</h1>



<p id="9fd5">The reason for this could be buyer perception.&nbsp;<mark>In&nbsp;</mark><mark>‘buy one, get one free’, you’re forcing the prospect to take action before they get a deal and the initial purchase is marked at full price.</mark></p>



<p id="1804"><mark>However, with half off, the initial item is seen to be 50% less than it normally is.</mark><mark>&nbsp;People perceive it as a better deal.&nbsp;</mark><mark>According to Grewal and Marmorstein,&nbsp;</mark><mark>“</mark><mark>consumers show a tendency to assess the utility of price savings as a proportion of the item’s price.”</mark></p>



<p id="213f">Moving forward, in your own marketing efforts, it’s clear that the power of ‘buy one, get one’ has faded and in a price-conscious, competitive space, the deep discount rules all.</p>
